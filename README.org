** Summary

The navigel package is a library that makes it simpler for Emacs Lisp
developers to define user-interfaces based on tablists (also known as
tabulated-lists).  Overriding a few (CL) methods and calling
`navigel-open' is all that's required to get a nice UI to navigate
your domain objects (files, music library, database, etc.).

Navigel displays "entities" in a tablist. An "entity" is whatever you
want that has a name.  If an entity defines some "children", then
pressing ~RET~ on the entity will list its children in another
tablist.

Some features of navigel include:

- pressing ~RET~ on an entity lists the entity's children in another
  tablist;
- pressing ~^~ opens the parent of the current entity;
- pressing ~m~ marks the entity at point;
- pressing ~d~ deletes the marked entities.

This package depends on [[https://github.com/politza/tablist][tablist]] to get support for marking and more.

** Usage

This code is a library and is meant for Emacs Lisp developers. The
source code is well documented and organized in sections. Please have
a look at it.

Please have a look at the [[file:examples/navigel-examples-fs.el][examples/navigel-examples-fs.el]] file for an
example on how to use the library. This file guides the reader through
an implementation of a tablist-based directory navigator with support
for marking and deleting:
