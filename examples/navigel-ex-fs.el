;;; Commentary:

;; This file is an example usage of navigel.  It guides the reader
;; through an implementation of a tablist-based directory navigator.

;; In this example, we will implement a tablist-based UI to navigate
;; the folders of your computer.  As in dired, we want one file or
;; directory per line.  Pressing `RET' on a line should open the file
;; or directory at point.  Pressing `m' should mark the file at point
;; while `d' should delete all marked files.

;;; Code:

(require 'f)

(require 'navigel)

;; Navigel is based on the notion of "entity".  In our example of a
;; directory navigator, the entities will be absolute filenames.

;; Navigel requires the developer to implement a command that calls
;; `navigel-open' on the initial entity.  Navigel also requires an
;; application name dynamically bound in the variable `navigel-app'.
;; This name is meant to disambiguate method definitions and is *not*
;; visible to the user.  In this example, we use `navigel-ex-fs'
;; as name.  The code below defines the command:

(defun navigel-ex-fs-list-files (&optional directory)
  "List files of DIRECTORY, home directory if nil."
  (interactive (list (getenv "HOME")))
  (let ((navigel-app 'navigel-ex-fs))
    (navigel-open (f-expand directory) nil)))

;; For this command to display the files in the home directory (i.e.,
;; "~/"), navigel needs a way to get the children of a file entity.
;; Specifying behavior with navigel is done through method overriding.
;; How to get the children of an entity should be specified by
;; overriding the method `navigel-children':

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-children (directory callback)
  "Call CALLBACK with the files in DIRECTORY as parameter."
  (funcall callback (f-entries directory)))

;; `navigel-method' (which is syntactic sugar around `cl-defmethod')
;; is used to override the methods of navigel.  To distinguish this
;; override of `navigel-children' from other overrides made by other
;; navigel clients, the first parameter to `navigel-method' must be
;; the name of the application saved in `navigel-app' in the command
;; above.

;; At this point, you should be able to type `M-x
;; navigel-ex-fs-list-files RET' to get a buffer showing all
;; files and folders in your home directory.  If you move the point to
;; a folder and press `RET', a new buffer should open listing its
;; files and folders.  If you type `M-x imenu RET', you can select one
;; entity of the buffer using completion: I recommend binding this
;; command or `counsel-imenu' to a key (e.g., to `M-i') because this
;; can be useful in many kinds of buffers.

;; A problem though: the absolute filenames (e.g., "/home/me/.bashrc")
;; are shown whereas a user probably expects to see basenames (e.g.,
;; ".bashrc") as in all file browsers.  We can easily change that by
;; overriding the `navigel-name' method:

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-name (file)
  (f-filename file))

;; This is much better.  With `RET', we can easily navigate from a
;; folder to its sub-folders.  Nevertheless, we have no way yet to
;; navigate back, i.e., from a folder to its parent.  To do that, we
;; need to override the `navigel-parent' method whose responsibility
;; is to return the parent entity of the entity passed as parameter:

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-parent (file)
  (f-dirname file))

;; You should now be able to press `^' to go to the parent directory
;; of the current one.

;; Pressing `RET' on a folder correctly opens the folder in another
;; navigel buffer.  But, just like in `dired', you might want that
;; pressing `RET' on a file opens the file itself.  This can be done
;; by overriding `navigel-open':

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-open (file _target)
  (if (f-file-p file)
      (find-file file)
    (cl-call-next-method)))

;; The `cl-call-next-method' call is used to express that we don't
;; have anything specific to do for a non-file first parameter and
;; that we want the default behavior.  This works perfectly fine!

;; We can improve the list of files a bit by adding some more
;; information about each file.  For example, we could have a first
;; column representing the size of each file.  We start by
;; implementing a function returning the size of its file argument:

(defun navigel-ex-fs-size (file)
  "Return FILE size as number of bytes."
  (nth 7 (file-attributes file)))

;; We now specify the column values for each file by overriding
;; `navigel-entity-to-columns':

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-entity-to-columns (file)
  (vector (number-to-string (navigel-ex-fs-size file))
          (navigel-name file)))

;; The code above specifies that the first column of a file line will
;; contain the file size and the second will contain the filename.  We
;; aren't exactly done yet as we also need to specify what each column
;; should look like.  This is done by overriding
;; `navigel-tablist-format':

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-tablist-format (_entity)
  (vector (list "Size (B)" 10 nil :right-align t)
          (list "Name" 0 t)))

;; This code defines the format of columns. The first column will have
;; "Size (B)" as title to indicate that the displayed numbers
;; represent the size in bytes.  The first column will be 10
;; characters wide and the numbers will be right aligned.  The second
;; column will have "Name as title and will take the rest of the
;; buffer width.  Read the documentation of `tabulated-list-format' to
;; get more information about the column format specification.

;; By default, navigel first sets the header information and then
;; proceeds to read the children of the current entity to display
;; them.  If you need to use the list of children to decide the format
;; of the header, you can override `navigel-tablist-format-children',
;; which is called _after_ the entities returned by `navigel-children'
;; are available.

;; As a final step, we might want to be able to delete files from the
;; file system.  This can be done by overriding `navigel-delete':

(navigel-method navigel-ex-fs navigel-delete (file &optional callback)
  (f-delete file)
  (funcall callback))

;; The `funcall' is here to tell navigel that deletion is
;; finished. You can now mark files with `m' and delete them with `D'.

;; By default, all entities of the new application will be displayed
;; in their own buffers, named using the generic function
;; `navigel-name'.  Users of your application can ask navigel to reuse
;; the same buffer for all entities in the app by customizing the
;; variable `navigel-single-buffer-apps'.  The name of this single
;; buffer when it is displaying a given entity is constructed using
;; the generic function `navigel-single-buffer-name'.
